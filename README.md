# Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai (NodeJS)

### 1. Overview
The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Mocha/Chai

with a set of basic but useful and famous algorithms, 
that you can find interesting to know. The core idea with unit 
testing is to test a function when giving it certain set of inputs.
