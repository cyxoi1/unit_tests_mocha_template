# Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai (NodeJS)

## 1. Overview
The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Mocha/Chai 
to do unit tests in NodeJS. All unit tests were done 
with a set of basic but useful and famous algorithms, 
that you can find interesting to know. The core idea with unit 
testing is to test a function when giving it certain set of inputs.

## 2. Prerequisites
### _2.1. Node_  
Your Machine should have node and npm installed.
Install the node.js LTS version from [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
(npm gets installed along with node automatically).  
You can use these commands to check the successful installation of node and npm.  
`npm -v     // will return installed npm version`  
`node -v    // will return installed node version`

### _2.1 Mocha_
Mocha is a JavaScript Test Framework that 
runs on Node.js and Browser.  
Installation: (Run the below commands in terminal or cmd)  
`npm install --global mocha`
`npm install --save-dev mocha`  

Note: To run Mocha, we need Node.js v4 or newer.  
`—- global` helps to install the Mocha on computer at global level which helps to run mocha test through command line.  
`—- save-dev` helps to add the mocha as dependency in package.json file for that particular project.
